Ideas Generator

Many of the best and most influential ideas in history are simply a combination with 
two ideas or concepts. The way that most ideas have come to be for much of human history 
has been through happenstance, when two seemingly unrelated ideas happened to present 
themselves within an innovator's working memory. For example, Einstein conceived of the theory of 
special relativity working at a patent office, where he was exposed to many patent 
applications proposing methods to synchronize clocks over long distances for train 
travel. 

This application aims to accelerate the rate at which users can arrive at new 
and hopefully influential ideas by unlocking the vast contents of their long-term 
memories for processing in their working memories.

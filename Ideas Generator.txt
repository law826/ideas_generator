Ideas GeneratorSummary:  	Many of the best and most influential ideas in history are simply a combination with two other ideas or concepts. The way that most ideas have come to be for much of human history has been through happenstance, when two seemingly unrelated ideas happened to present themselves within an innovator’s working memory. Einstein conceived of the theory of special relativity working at a patent office, where he was exposed to many patent applications proposing methods to synchronize clocks over long distances for train travel.	This application aims to accelerate the rate at which users can arrive at new and hopefully influential ideas by unlocking the vast contents of their long-term memories for processing in their working memories.
